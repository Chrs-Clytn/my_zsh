# Welcome to My Zsh
***

## Task
Here i am creating my own shell in order to carry out basic tasks.

## Description
Only basic command lines are able to be executed; no pipes, redirections or any other advanced features. The executables are those found in the path, as indicated in the PATH variable.

If the executable cannot be found, I display an error message and display the prompt again. Errors are dealt with and display the appropriate message on the error output. 

I implement the following builtins: echo, cd, setenv, unsetenv, env, exit, pwd and which.

## Installation
all you have to do is run make.
simples.

## Usage
then you can run 
```
./my_zsh
```
this should open up the prompt:
 ZSH $>
from there you can type your commands.

accepted builtins are:
echo
exit
cd
pwd
which
env
setenv
unsetenv
